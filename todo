- [ ] Prohibit assigning non-safe types as keys or values
- [x] __repr__ should operate on copied objects
- [x] mutations API
- [ ] for proper finalization we might want to track all objects
      we ever processed by making a list of weaklinks to them. Once
      all subinterpreters are dead we can iterate through the list
      cleaning all of the objects that still have dangling reeferences
      (can be due to objects having cycles? need to test this.)
- [ ] add error checks on all mutex operations
- [ ] remote error serialization
- [ ] add a test for pickling a mapping mutated between interpreters
- [ ] add a torture test that starts 50 interpreters and shuts them
- [ ] add a test for mutation api of shared objects
- [ ] implement "Record" type - an variation of tuple, but with an
      indirection to the underlying storage (to make proxying more
      efficient)
- [ ] api to enable uvloop.run()
- [ ] test multiple memhives, it should be possible to nest them
- [ ] add simple RPC API
- [ ] investigate using singledispatch for proxying collections
      and complex scalars
- [ ] renaming the default queueing system to "Hub"
- [ ] detach it from hive/subs; pass it as an argument to workers
- [ ] hive/subs should implement low-level threadpools to listen on
      queues, do unblocking queue pushes, wait on locks for accessing
      shared state
- [ ] ensure that you can only pull after you fulfill the previous
      pull request
- [ ] detach mutable index from hub/sub -- pass it as an arg to workers
- [ ] add worker should be non-blocking (for async)
- [ ] add `await ensure_workers_started()`
