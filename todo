- Prohibit assigning non-safe types as keys or values
- __repr__ should operate on copied objects
- mutations API
- for proper finalization we might want to track all objects
  we ever processed by making a list of weaklinks to them. Once
  all subinterpreters are dead we can iterate through the list
  cleaning all of the objects that still have dangling reeferences
  (can be due to objects having cycles? need to test this.)
